# Sportsadmin scraper
This project attempts to provide a way to get access to the schedule of games from the Danish national icehockey league.
This is done through a scraper, as sportsadmin does not seem to provide an API to access it.

The scraper will scrape the schedule from the sportsadmin site and will divide the matches into rounds.
The interval that defines a round, and the site that has the schedule can be configured.
